# Rent a Book TypeScript

# Installing the dependencies

In the projects root directory

```
npm install

```

This will install all the dependencies in the package.json

Then:

> Go into the src directory and run the start script

```
cd ./src

npm start

```

This will run the start script in the package.json (this runs webpack --watch which will automatically recompile index.ts in the src directory on every change)

In the public folder/directory

open index.html (if you are using visual studio code as your text editor use liveserver extension)
